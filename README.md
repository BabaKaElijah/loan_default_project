# Loan Default Prediction System
End to End Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan.
It demonstrates a complete machine learning lifecycle from raw data to a production ready application.

The focus is not only on model accuracy but also on engineering practices used in real world ML systems.

The project includes automated training pipelines, model versioning, REST APIs, web interfaces, Docker containerization, and CI using GitHub Actions.

## Problem Statement
Financial institutions must assess loan risk accurately.

Poor predictions result in
- Financial losses from defaults
- Missed revenue from overly strict approvals
This system uses applicant and loan features to predict default risk and provide a probability score.
